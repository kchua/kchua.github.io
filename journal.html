title: Kurtland's Math Journal
---

<p>
  Welcome to my math journal!
  Over the past few years, I have grown to really enjoy mathematics, so I'm quite excited to start this up and hopefully demonstrate why I find the subject so fascinating.
  This journal will consist of proof attempts, random mathematical musings, as well as really cool connections to other interesting areas.
  No guarantees of correctness!
  That being said, if you do find errors in any of the entries or if you would like to discuss anything, please feel free to reach out.
