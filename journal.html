title: Kurtland's Math Journal
---

<p>
  Welcome to my math journal!
  Over the past few years, I have learned to appreciate the elegance of mathematics and the mode of thinking required, so I'm quite excited to start this up and hopefully demonstrate why I find math so fascinating.
  This journal will consist of proof attempts, random mathematical musings, as well as really cool connections to other interesting areas.

  I make no guarantees about the correctness of any of the contents of this journal.
  That being said, if you do find errors in any of the entries or if you would like to discuss anything, please feel free to reach out!
