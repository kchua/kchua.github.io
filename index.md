### About Me

<img style="float: right;" width="175" src="images/profile.jpg"/>

I am an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley entering my fourth year, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

I currently work in Prof. Sergey Levine's lab as an undergraduate researcher, working on model-based reinforcement learning together with my mentors Roberto Calandra and Rowan McAllister.

My interests include reinforcement learning, machine learning, as well as pure mathematics.
