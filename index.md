    <p>
      I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
      I currently work in Prof. Sergey Levine's lab as an undergraduate researcher, working on model-based reinforcement learning together with my mentors Roberto Calandra and Rowan McAllister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting Fall 2019, I will be attending Princeton University as a PhD student in Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interests include reinforcement learning, theoretical machine learning, as well as mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This semester, I am a TA for EECS 126, an upper-division course on probability and random processes.
