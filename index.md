### About Me

<img style="float: right;" width="250" src="images/profile.jpg"/>

I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

I currently work in Prof. Sergey Levine's lab as an undergraduate researcher, working on model-based reinforcement learning together with my mentors Roberto Calandra and Rowan McAllister.

My interests include reinforcement learning, machine learning, as well as pure mathematics.

I will be TAing once again for EECS 126, an upper-division course on probability and random processes, this upcoming spring semester!

You may reach me at kchua (at) berkeley (dot) edu.
