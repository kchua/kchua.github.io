    <p>
      I am currently a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by <a href="https://jasondlee88.github.io/">Jason D. Lee</a>. My research was previously supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have previously studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
      There, I was an undergraduate researcher in Prof. Sergey Levine's lab, working on model-based reinforcement learning together with Roberto Calandra and Rowan McAllister.
      I have also been involved with Facebook AI Research as a research intern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am broadly interested in exploring theoretical machine learning.
      Recently, I have been focusing on meta-learning and related areas, aiming to formalize structures shared among tasks that allow for sample-efficient learning.
