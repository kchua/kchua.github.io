## About Me

    <p>
      I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Jason Lee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have previously studied at the University of California, Berkeley, where I received my degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
      During my time at Berkeley, I was an undergraduate researcher in Prof. Sergey Levine's lab, where I worked on model-based reinforcement learning together with Roberto Calandra and Rowan McAllister.
      I have also been involved with Facebook AI Research as a research intern.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am broadly interested in exploring theoretical machine learning and deep learning, and understanding how insights from these areas could be leveraged to both better understand existing learning algorithms and drive further developments.
